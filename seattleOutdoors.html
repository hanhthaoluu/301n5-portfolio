        <ul class="list" id="outdoor-activities-list">
          <li>Hike Mount Rainier - Paradise in July to see the colorful field of wild flowers. See if you can spot deers and foxes while you are there.</li>
          <li>Stroll along the Alki Beach for the glorious sunset.  The view of the downtown Seattle skyline is unbeatable from Alki. During the summer months, take the water taxi from the Alki Beach to downtown Seattle. At Alki, if you look close enough, you can spot some seals, sea otters and even owls.</li>
          <li>View the breathtaking view of the Puget Sound up high from the Carkeek Park Play Area and then walk down to the beach. During the lowest tides you can admire starfish, sea cucumbers, sea anemones, crabs, and other sea creatures in their natural habitats.</li>
          <li>Take a walk at the Washington Park Arboretum in May along the glowing Azeleas and Rhododendron trails.</li>
          <li>Go to the Olympic Farm Game to visit all the exotic animals and feed the goats.</li>
          <li>When it's 90s degrees in Seattle, go to the Lake Crescent, up north, near the Canadian border.  Don't forget to stop by the Sol Duc Hotspring while you are up there. Lake Crescent is the most beautiful and crystal clear lake in the NW.</li>
          <li>In the summer, take the gondola up to the Crystal Mountain. Looking out from the gondola on your way up to the Crystal Mountain is the most transquil and unforgetable experience ever.</li>
          <li>In April, see the cherry blossoms at the UW Quad. Remember to track the blooms with Cherry Blossoms Live Stream so you don't miss the special moment. April showers and winds tend to blow the blossoms away very quickly.</li>
          <li>During the month of April, Tulips Festival is a must. Pictures don't do it justice! Remember to take an earlier exit, Exit 225 (I believe) instead of Exit 226 and take the back roads from there so you are not stuck in a line of cars for one hour trying to get there.</li>
          <li>Visit Flower World, a fifteen acres nursery/animal farm/farm market, to find exotic plants and feed the chickens, sheeps and goats. Bring your camera for the peacock dances.</li>
